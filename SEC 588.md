## SEC 588: Cloud Penetration Testing
#### Cert: GIAC Cloud Penetration Tester (GCPN)

Equiping you with the latest in cloud-focused penetration testing techniques and teach you how to assess cloud environments. Diving into topics like cloud-based microservices, in-memory data stores, serverless functions, Kubernetes meshes, and containers, as well as identifying and testing in cloud-first and cloud-native applications. You learn specific tactics for penetration testing in Azure and Amazon Web Services, particularly important given that AWS and Microsoft account for more than half the market. It's one thing to assess and secure a data center, but it takes a specialized skillset to truly assess and report on the risk that an organization faces if its cloud services are left insecure.
