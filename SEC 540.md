## SEC 540: Cloud Security and DevSecOps Automation
#### Cert: GIAC Cloud Security Automation 

Teaching a methodology to secure modern Cloud and DevOps environments. Students learn how to implement more than 20 DevSecOps security controls to build, test, deploy, and monitor cloud infrastructure and services. Immersive hand-on labs ensure that students not only understand theory, but how to configure and implement each security control. By embracing the DevOps culture, students will walk away from SEC540 battle-tested and ready to build to their organization's Cloud and DevSecOps Security Program.
